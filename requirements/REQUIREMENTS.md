# Requirements – Add Vehicle Feature

## User Story
As a user, I want to add a vehicle to the system so that it can be stored and viewed later.

## Acceptance Criteria

AC1: When a vehicle with a non-empty make, non-empty model, and a year greater than or equal to 1900 is submitted, the system successfully stores and returns the vehicle.

AC2: When a vehicle has a missing make, missing model, or a year less than 1900, the system rejects the vehicle and reports an error.
